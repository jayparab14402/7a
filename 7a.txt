A)Performing table join
Dataset we are using:
tl_2013_06_tract.zip ca_tracts_pop.csv
1.Add vector layer “tl_2013_06_tract.shp”
2.Right click on this layer in layer pane and select “Open Attribute Table”
3.Observe the attributes of this shape file, to join table with this shape 
file we need to have one common column, in this case GEOID is the unique identifier
 for each tract and it can be used to join any other table containing the same ID.
4.Open the .csv file “ca_tracts_pop.csv” with notepad. Each row of this file contains
 information about tract with unique identifier as we have seen in previous step. Here
 the same field is named as GEO.id2 in csv. In this csv file D001 column has population
 value for each census tract.
5.We can import the above file directly in QGIS but the default type for each column will
 be String (text). This is fine for all the columns except D001 which contains Population 
value and if this is imported as text then it will not allow us to perform any mathematical 
operations on this column.
6.To tell QGIS to import this column as number we need to create one text file with .csvt extension,
 this file will be used to specify just the data types of each column as shown below. Save this file as
 “ca_tracts_pop.csvt” in the same folder.

“String”, “String”, “String”, “String”, “String”, “Integer”,

7.Now we are ready to import csv file, go to layer  Add Delimited Text Layer…
8.Browse to the location where the csv file is stored and select it. Select file format as CSV. Since 
we are importing this file as table, we need to specify that this file contains no geometry. Select 
No Geometry option and click on Ok.
9.The csv is imported as table in QGIS.
10.Double click on tl_2013_06_tract layer in layer pane to open the Layer Properties window.
11.On layer properties window click on Join tab and click on plus (+) button at the bottom to 
create new table join.
12.In the Add vector join dialog box select ca_tracts_pop as Join layer, select GEO.id2 as Join 
field and GEOID as Target field. Click Ok.
Click on Ok button on Layer properties window and then close it.
13.Now, right click on tl_2013_06_tract and select Open Attribute Table.
14.We can see new ca_tracts_pop_D001 is added for each feature. Close the attribute table.
15.Double click on the same layer. Click on style tab, select Graduated from the dropdown. We need
 to assign different color to each census tract based on population count, so select ca_tracts_pop_D001 
as the column. Select any color ramp from the drop down. In mode select Quantile (Equal Count). Next click
 on Classify button, now we can see different color is assigned to various population ranges. Click on Ok.
